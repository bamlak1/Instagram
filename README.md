## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had a lot of trouble with formatting in the beginning because I could not visualize what to do first. SInce this projecgt was more free based, I could not simply follow a video to complete it. This required more thought about the layout and individual process of what to include and when.
