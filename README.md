## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
My biggest challenge was allowing the user to change the default tip values on the bar. It was almost working but someting in the ViewController was bugging out, claiming that I could not make an array of variables that were going to be input. If this had worked, I would have been able to set different tip percentages in the bar and the app would have memorized those for the next use.
